    "Blockchain (blockchain) translates as \"chain of blocks\". This is a method of storing data that is protected from forgery. It lies, for example, at the heart of the bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "A blockchain is really a sequence of blocks, and each block contains some useful information. So the sequence of bitcoin is a list of transactions for a certain period of time: who, to whom, when and how much money was transferred. This list is provided with a random number and some service data, including a hash - a number that, according to a certain formula, depends on the rest of the block and the hash of the previous block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash must be less than a certain number. At the same time, the formula by which the hash is calculated is designed in such a way that it is impossible to get a sufficiently small hash otherwise than by going through different values of a random number. Therefore, if an attacker decides to fake the blockchain — for example, insert a block in its middle with a record that all people transferred all their money to him — he will face a problem. He will have to pick up a new random number not only in the fake block, but also in all subsequent ones, because the hash of each next block depends on the hash of the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires incredibly large computing power, so the blockchain as a whole is protected from such attacks.\n",
